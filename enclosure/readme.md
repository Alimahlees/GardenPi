<h2 align="center">BOM For GardenPi</h2>
<br>

There are a <b><em>lot</em></b of parts that went into building <b><em>our</em></b> version of GardenPi. GardenPi is designed to be scaled from a few zones to as many as 32 water zones or anywhere in between. Since you have to build your own enclosure, you can decide what parts of GardenPi meet your needs (such as the need for power control) and decide what you need from there. I love lots of data so I have sensors for AC and DC power, water utilization (albeit not from GardenPi), humidity, barometric pressure, etc. So when you view this parts list, keep in mind you may not need everything listed here.

### System Enclosure - Polycase YH-141206 NEMA Hinged Electrical Enclosure
The system enclosure that I chose was pretty large due to all of the parts that needed to fit inside. I chose not the cheapest enclosure, but one that would do the job for me.

### Canakit Raspberry Pi4 Model B - 4GB
You could get by with a lower powered version of the RaspberryPi, but I choose the Rpi4 with 4/GB RAM for this project.

### Samsung Endurance Pro 128GB SD Card
I chose the Samsung Pro Endurance 128GB card for several reasons. First I have never had any issues with any Samsung SD card that I have purchased, next the Pro Endurance is designed to be a very long endurance card. The 128GB cards is rated to last up to 43,800 hours of continuous video recording, while the 64GB card was half that time. Since the 128GB card is good for a full 5 years of continuous video recording, I figured it would be good with the little bit GardenPi would be doing with it.

### Geekworm Aluminum alloy Armor case with dual fans
I chose this case because I will need maximum cooling where I will be placing this system. My ambient temperature in the shed where my enclosure is installed can reach 135°F in the summer. I have had amazing luck running a Pi3B in 120-degree weather here in Phoenix for years with just a cooling fan in the overall enclosure for my pool control system. I will try this case out to see how well it works and how long the fans last. I track enclosure and Pi CPU temps every minute, I have not had an throttling issues as of yet, even on the hottest of days.

### Sainsmart 5V 2A 8-Channel Solid State Relay Module (High Level Trigger) x 4
One thing I have learned in my past projects with a lot of electrical and sensors, mechanical relays can cause interference in various parts of the system. I chased a problem wit my pool control project where every time I triggered my mechanical relay, I would get weird reading and other glitches, even with optoisolated mechanical relays. I moved to solid-state relays and never looked back.
